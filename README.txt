Sign-In Sheet

Description: 
The sign-in sheet is a Java progam the uses the built-in GUI provided in Java's library. The purpose of the the program is to replace a paper version of the sign-in sheet that is used to track in-store services, like glass cutting, knife sharpening, or screen repair. 

How it works: 
First you create a new customer file, which stores all customers info, to start off. Then from there you can enter customer's name, phone number, requests, description of requests or notes. Once you select a request from the drop down box, you'll be greeted with an estimate window; this is where you'll fill in the specifics of the request, like size, quantiy, and other options for the request. If customer has more of the same request you can click the "+" button to commit to that request and add another estimate. If customer has different requests, like glass and screen repair, click "submit" button and then select a different request from the drop down box; request will stack on top of each other once submitted. If you want to change your current estimate, just change the numbers and click "Get Estimate" button to update change. After filling out the specifics to the request, click "Get Estimate" button and a total estimate cost will be present for that request and you can submit the request by clicking "Submit". After filling the customer's info and requests, you can click "Add Customer" to add customer to sign-in table. You can delete customers by selecting a customer from the table and clicking on "Delete Customer" button. You can view customer details in more detail by selecting customer from table and clicking "Get Customer Details" button.  

The program is divided as such, There is a main progam that is responsible for creating the main sign-in sheet table. the main sign-in sheet table is responsible for displaying info and providing an interface. Estimates are split into GUI classes and estimate classes the GUI classes are responsible for displaying interface; estimate classes are responsible for the actual calculations of cost. All estimate classes are children of an abstract class called "Estimate" and stores common info that all estimates have with each other. Customers info is stored in a customer class.
